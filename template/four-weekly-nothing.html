<p>Dear %user_nicename%,</p>

<p>As you haven’t recorded a weight on the 2 Day Wythenshawe website in the last month, we thought we would send you an email with a few words of support if you need them.  We recommend weighing yourself and recording this regularly to keep yourself on track. </p>

<p>If you are hoping to lose more weight and you feel as though you are on track for achieving your personal target weight then well done! Weight loss can significantly reduce your risk of breast cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Just remember to keep an eye on your personal <a href="%healthy_weight_range_link%" target="_blank">healthy weight range</a> (calculated by your dietitian), so you know what weight is safe and healthy for you.</p>

<p>Alternatively if you feel that you might be gaining weight then it is important to get to grips with weight gain early on. Weight loss can significantly reduce your risk of breast cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Re-gaining even a small amount of weight can undo your hard work. Don’t worry though, weight re-gain can happen to us all and there is lots that can be done to get you back on track! Maybe it’s time to check a few things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Are you weighing yourself correctly? Avoid weighing yourself immediately following your diet (restricted) days as people tend to lose body water (as well as body fat) around this time. As you regain some body water on your Mediterranean (non-diet) days this will look like weight gain on the scales. One way around this would be to weigh yourself weekly on the morning of your first diet day each week. </li>
	<li>Are your portion sizes starting to creep up? Try re-weighing some foods you eat regularly - it can be easy to overdo foods we pour out like cereals, pasta or oil. </li>
	<li>Are you including more treat foods or alcohol in your diet? </li>
	</li>Are you being as active? </li>
</ul>

<p>Perhaps you are someone who has lost weight but you are struggling to shift those extra pounds. If this is you and you feel as though you are on track with your diet and exercise then remember that maintaining any weight you have lost is a fantastic achievement and will have benefits for your health. We know that weight loss naturally starts to slow down as your body adjusts to running on less food. Staying active and getting enough protein in your diet (from foods like meat, fish, eggs, beans and pulses, like lentils) will help. Activity and protein help you to maintain your muscles and more muscles means you’ll be burning more calories. </p>

<p>If you would like further support around shifting those extra pounds then don’t forget <a href="%keeping_the_weight_off_link%" target="_blank">'The 2 Day Diet: keeping the weight off'</a> booklet. Section 1 helps you to reduce your allocated portions of carbs, protein and fat on your Mediterranean (non-diet) days if you think you might need that extra push.</p>
