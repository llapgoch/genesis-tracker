<p>Dear %user_nicename%,</p>
<p>You have recorded a weight on the The Family History Lifestyle website which suggests that you have lost weight.</p>

<p>If you had hoped to lose weight then you are now one step closer to your target weight, so well done! Weight loss can significantly reduce your risk of breast cancer, heart disease and diabetes. Just remember to keep an eye on your personal <a href="%healthy_weight_range_link%" target="_blank">healthy weight range</a> (calculated by your dietitian), so you know what weight is safe and healthy for you.</p>

<p>If you have lost weight but you had intended to maintain your weight, then maybe it’s time to consider doing one diet (restricted) day per week rather than two (if you are not already) which will help you to maintain your weight. Alternatively if you have increased your activity levels recently then this is great news for your health, but you may need to think about having a few more healthy snacks in the day to compensate for the extra calories you burn during exercise.</p>

<p>If you have any specific questions for the team then you can contact us on 0161 291 4412 or email us at <a href="mailto:%contact_email%">%contact_email%</a></p>

<p>Wishing you all the best and looking forward to seeing you at your 12 month appointment.<br />
The Family History Lifestyle Team.</p>
