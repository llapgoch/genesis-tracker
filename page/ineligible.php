           <h2>BMI of less than 25</h2>
           <p>As the research study is testing a diet and exercise weight loss plan, women who already have a healthy weight with a BMI between 19 and 25 are unable to take part. We would advise these women to maintain a healthy weight by following a healthy diet and exercise regime and continuing to lead a healthy lifestyle to minimise their risk of conditions such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, stroke and high cholesterol. </p>
           
           <h2>No access to a telephone and high/moderate speed Internet</h2>
           <p>The study requires women to use the interactive study website to monitor their weight loss and other lifestyle changes and have regular telephone and online support from the study team.</p>
           
           <h2>Pre-existing health conditions</h2>
           <p>Women who have previously been diagnosed with cancer or other health conditions (heart disease, angina, diabetes, stroke or high cholesterol) are unable to take part in the study as we are testing a diet and exercise programme for the prevention of these conditions.  Further information or support services in relation to cancer and these other health conditions can be found below: </p>
           
           <h3>Breast Cancer</h3>

           </ul>
           
           <h3>Other cancers</h3>
           <ul>
               <li><strong>Cancer Research UK</strong><br /><a href="http://www.cancerresearchuk.org" target="_blank">http://www.cancerresearchuk.org</a> is a UK charity that provides information and support on 200 different cancers.</li>

               <li><strong>Macmillan</strong><br /><a href="http://macmillan.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://macmillan.org.uk</a> is a UK charity that provides a range of cancer care services for people who have been diagnosed with cancer and their families</li>
               <li><strong>Diabetes UK</strong><br /><a href="http://www.diabetes.org.uk/">www.diabetes.org.uk</a> is a charity that helps people manage their diabetes by providing information, advice and support. There are currently 3.8 million people in the UK with diabetes, including an estimated 630,000 people who have Type 2 diabetes but do not know it.</li>
               <li><strong>British Heart Foundation</strong><br /><a href="http://www.bhf.org.uk">www.bhf.org.uk</a> is a charity aiming to help prevent and manage heart disease risk by providing information about their condition (including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, angina and heart attacks).</li>
           </ul>
           
           <p>In addition there may have been other factors which made you ineligible for this study. These are outlined below with information about support services:</p>
           
           <ul>
               <li><strong>Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)</strong><br />Taking combined HRT which includes oestrogen and progesterone can increase the risk of breast cancer, so it is not generally recommended. Weight loss is unlikely to reduce your risk of breast cancer when you are on HRT however weight loss is still recommended as this will help to reduce your risk of other cancers, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and dementia. The decision to take HRT can be difficult as HRT is an effective treatment for menopausal symptoms and can reduce risks of bone fractures and bowel cancer. If you are currently taking combined HRT and have concerns about this, we suggest you discuss this with your GP.</li>
               <li><strong>Medication for high cholesterol</strong><br />The study is aimed at women who do not already take medication for high cholesterol such as a statin as we are interested in the effect of diet and exercise in the prevention of this condition. If you are taking a statin it is still very important to follow a healthy diet and exercise regime and lead a healthy lifestyle to reduce your risk of heart disease.</li>
               <li><strong>Alcohol or drug dependency</strong><br />requires specialist support. NHS choices have information that can help you find local alcohol and drug services in your area. Simply enter your postcode to find the service that is closest to you:
                   <ul class="addiction-links">
                       <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Support-services-for-alcohol-addiction/LocationSearch/295" target="_blank">Alcohol Services</a>
                         <li><a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Service-Search/Information-and-support-for-drug-misuse/LocationSearch/339" target="_blank">Drug Services</a>

                  </ul>
                </li>
           </ul>
           
           <h3>Eating Disorders</h3>
           <p>Such as binge eating disorder or bulimia require specialist psychological support. If you are concerned that you may have an eating disorder, contact your GP to discuss your concerns and treatment options.</p>
           <h3>Already successfully dieting and losing weight</h3>
           <p>The study is trying to help motivate women to join and keep to a weight loss programme to see if we can reduce risk of disease. If you are already successfully dieting it is best to keep with your current weight loss plan</p>
           
           <h3>Physical activity</h3>
           <p>As the research study is testing a combined diet and exercise weight loss plan, people with an existing condition that could be made worse by exercise or could make it very difficult for you to exercise, will be unable to take part in the study. Most people can benefit from increased activity levels. If you want support and do not know what is available locally then we suggest you contact your GP practice. </p>
           
           <p>Best Wishes<br />
